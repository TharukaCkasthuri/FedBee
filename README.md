# FedBee

FedBee is a Federated Learning (FL) algorithm inspired by the efficient and dynamic collaboration of bees within a hive as they gather resources and produce honey. Much like bees working together, FedBee enables clients to contribute locally trained models that are combined to form a more robust global model. This framework aims to enhance FL performance by introducing a novel aggregation strategy based on the AdaBoost classification algorithm. By leveraging AdaBoost, FedBee improves model aggregation, resulting in increased accuracy and adaptability, ultimately optimizing the federated learning process for more efficient and effective outcomes. It is specifically designed for researchers and engineers looking to advance federated learning through innovative aggregation techniques.
