# FedBee

FedBee is a federated learning algorithm inspired by the efficient and dynamic way bees work together in a hive to gather resources and create honey. Similar to bees collaborating to collect and process resources, FedBee allows clients to contribute locally trained models that are combined into a stronger global model. This framework aims to improve FL model performance by introducing a new aggregation strategy based on the AdaBoost classification algorithm. By utilizing AdaBoost, FedBee enhances model aggregation to improve accuracy and adaptability, optimizing the federated learning process for more efficient and effective results. It is designed for researchers and engineers seeking to advance federated learning through innovative aggregation techniques.
